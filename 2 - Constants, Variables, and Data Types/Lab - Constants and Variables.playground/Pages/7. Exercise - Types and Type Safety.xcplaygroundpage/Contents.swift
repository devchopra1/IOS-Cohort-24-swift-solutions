## Exercise - Types and Type Safety
 
 Declare two variables, one called `firstDecimal` and one called `secondDecimal`. Both should have decimal values. Look at both of their types by holding Option and clicking the variable name.
 */
var firstDecimal: Double = 1.0
var secondDecimal: Double = 2.0

//:  Declare a variable called `trueOrFalse` and give it a boolean value. Try to assign it to `firstDecimal` like so: `firstDecimal = trueOrFalse`. Does it compile? Print a statement to the console explaining why not, and remove the line of code that will not compile.
var trueOrFalse: Bool = true
//firstDecimal = trueOrFalse
print("we cant assign a different data type value to a variable that is already set to that data type")
//:  Declare a variable and give it a string value. Then try to assign it to `firstDecimal`. Does it compile? Print a statement to the console explaining why not, and remove the line of code that will not compile.
var variable: String = "hello"
//firstDecimal = variable
print("we cant assign a different data type value to a variable that is already set to that data type")

//:  Finally, declare a variable with a whole number value. Then try to assign it to `firstDecimal`. Why won't this compile even though both variables are numbers? Print a statement to the console explaining why not, and remove the line of code that will not compile.
var wholeNumber: Int = 1
//firstDecimal = wholeNumber
print("we cant assign a different data type value to a variable that is already set to that data type")
